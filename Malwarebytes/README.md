# Malwarebytes

## v3.7.1.2839

### Issues

1. Does not proactively scan files dropped to disk,
2. Executables with `etl`, `Config`, and `Manifest` file extensions ran using `CreateProcess` do not get scanned.

### Recommended Fix(?)

1. Include `IRP_MJ_CLEANUP` (and optionally `IRP_MJ_WRITE`) minifilter callback operations,
2. Do not whitelist `etl`, `Config`, and `Manifest` file extensions from scanning.

### Tested Environments

* Windows 7 x64 Home Premium
* Windows 7 x64 Ultimate
* Windows 10 x64 Pro
